# Python1

This is a Currency converter written in Python 2.7
I wrote it in 2.7 because I have a version that I wanted to make executable using py2exe

This version has been updated to access real time currency exchange rates using Yql and Json to access Yahoo  Finance 
online. 
The following 26 lines were taken from http://www.idiotinside.com/2015/01/28/create-a-currency-converter-in-php-python-javascript-and-jquery-using-yahoo-currency-api/
and modified to suit the needs of the program 
the rest of the code is my own, which I learned by doing several tutorials online. 
Please feel free to use any of the code if you like. 

Any suggestions/criticisms or feedback is appreciated
